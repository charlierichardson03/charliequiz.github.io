  <h1>OMG - A Quiz!</h1>
  <h2> Three Impactful Moments </h2>
  <h3> 1. I learned about the history of the internet, which was fascinating because it showed how fast our technology has developed in the past few decades. </h3>
  <h3> 2. I learned how to push and pull from github, which seems like it is going to be an essential tool for this semester. </h3>
  <h3> 3. I learned about hosting websites on Github. This also seems vital to the rest of the semester, because it is an easy way to show our work to others using the internet. </h3>
